## Getting Started

Since this app does not yet contain any API keys (the google books API does not require an API key), building this app on your own computer is as easy as:
- cloning the github repo (`https://github.com/holdermatthew5/11lab-301.git`) onto your machine.
- installing dependencies with `npm install`.
- creating the app in heroku with `heroku create`.
- pushing your new app to heroku with `git push heroku main`.

And finally, enjoying the app.

## Architecture

This project uses:
- express
- ejs
- superagent
- javascript
- html
- CSS
- node.js
- npm
- git
- github
- heroku
